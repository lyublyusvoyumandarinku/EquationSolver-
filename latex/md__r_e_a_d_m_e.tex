\item To run the program, the g++ compiler (Min\+GW, etc.) or any development environment that supports the C language must be installed on the device.
\item To run the project, you need to compile the project files with the extension .cpp using the command line (for example, like this\+: g++ \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}} \mbox{\hyperlink{func_8cpp}{func.\+cpp}} test.\+coo -\/o solve.\+exe where solve.\+exe -\/ an executable file that should then be run.
\item The program prompts the user to enter the coefficients of the equation (a, b, c). If the input is incorrect, the program will point it out and offer to repeat it. After execution, it will give the result\+: the number of roots of the equation and the roots themselves, if any, as well as the equation in standard form.
\item The program has built-\/in the ability to test on various input data (to start testing, you need to specify define TESTS on the command line). If any test is not passed, the program outputs all the input and output data of the failed test.
\item This program is also able to work with data by reading it from a file.
\item All functions of the program are provided with documenting comments that can be displayed via Doxygen
